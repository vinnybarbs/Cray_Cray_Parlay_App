# Fixes Applied - Date Timezone & NFL Stats Integration

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Major Updates

**GAME CHANGER**: Replaced Google searches with real NFL statistics API!

**What's New**:
- ✅ Real team records (W-L) from standings
- ✅ Team statistics (PPG, yards/game, offense/defense)
- ✅ Injury reports with player status
- ✅ Accurate, structured data instead of scraped articles

**Files Added**:
- `lib/services/nfl-stats.js` - NFL Stats service
- `NFL_STATS_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete documentation
- `TEST_NFL_STATS.md` - Testing guide

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/agents/research-agent.js` - Integrated NFL stats with Serper fallback
- `server.js` - Added `/debug/nfl-stats` endpoint

See `NFL_STATS_INTEGRATION.md` for full details.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Date Timezone Issue - FIXED
**Problem**: Picks were showing wrong dates because dates were being formatted in system timezone instead of Mountain Time (MT).

**Solution**: Updated all date formatting functions to explicitly use `America/Denver` timezone.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/agents/analyst-agent.js` - Lines 15, 21
- `lib/agents/research-agent.js` - Lines 82, 180, 263, 415
- `api/generate-parlay.js` - Line 89

**Changes Made**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (used system timezone):
d.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'numeric', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric' })

// AFTER (uses Mountain Time):
d.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'numeric', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric', timeZone: 'America/Denver' })
```

### 2. ✅ External Research Status - VERIFIED WORKING
**Problem**: User reported no external research happening.

**Investigation Results**:
- ✅ SERPER_API_KEY is configured and active
- ✅ Research agent is properly initialized in coordinator
- ✅ Research flow is correctly implemented with tiered approach
- ✅ All research logging is in place

**Research Flow** (from `coordinator.js` Phase 2):
1. Odds Agent fetches games → 
2. Research Agent performs deepResearch() →
3. Serper API queries for game analysis, injuries, trends →
4. Player-specific research for props (if applicable) →
5. Results enriched into game objects →
6. AI Analyst receives enriched data

**Expected Console Output When Research Runs**:
```
🔍 PHASE 2: ENHANCED RESEARCH
🔍 SMART TIERED RESEARCH: X games, Y legs needed, Medium risk
📊 Researching top Z games with moderate depth
  📡 Researching batch 1/N: X games
  🔍 Researching: Team A @ Team B (moderate depth)
    ✓ Using cached game research (or fresh API call)
✅ Research Phase Complete: X/Y games researched
```

**Status**: Not configured (player verification disabled)

**Impact**: 
- Player-team verification is skipped
- AI may occasionally assign players to wrong teams
- Not critical but recommended for player props accuracy

**To Fix** (Optional):
1. Get free API key from https://dashboard.api-football.com/register
3. Restart server
4. Player verification will auto-enable

## How to Verify Fixes

### Test Date Timezone:
1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Generate a parlay
3. Check that all dates show in Mountain Time format
4. Compare with game times from odds API (should match MT)

### Test External Research:
1. Check API key is configured: `node check-api-keys.js`
2. Start server with logging: `npm run dev`
3. Generate a parlay
4. Watch console for research phase logs:
   - Should see "PHASE 2: ENHANCED RESEARCH"
   - Should see "Researching: Team @ Team"
   - Should see "Research Phase Complete: X/Y games researched"
5. Check parlay output for research context in reasoning

### Verify All APIs Working:
Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
node check-api-keys.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Configured ODDS_API_KEY
✅ Configured SERPER_API_KEY
✅ Configured OPENAI_API_KEY
✅ Configured GEMINI_API_KEY
```

## Research Data Flow

```
User Request
    ↓
Coordinator.generateParlays()
    ↓
Phase 1: Odds Agent → Fetch games with odds
    ↓
Phase 2: Research Agent → deepResearch(games)
    ↓
    ├─ Prioritize games (by time, markets available)
    ├─ Batch research (10 games at a time)
    ├─ For each game:
    │   ├─ Query Serper API: "Team A vs Team B [date] injury report performance"
    │   ├─ Extract insights from top 5 results
    │   └─ Add player research if props available
    └─ Return enriched games with research field
    ↓
Phase 3: AI Analyst → Generate parlay with research context
    ↓
AI receives games with research in prompt
```

## Troubleshooting

### If research still not showing:

1. **Check API key is loaded**:
   ```bash
   node check-api-keys.js
   ```

2. **Check server logs** for these messages:
   - ✅ Good: "🔍 SMART TIERED RESEARCH"
   - ❌ Bad: "⚠️ No SERPER_API_KEY - skipping research enhancement"

3. **Verify .env file is loaded**:
   ```bash
   # Should show dotenv loading message
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check Serper API quota**:
   - Free tier: 2,500 searches/month
   - Visit: https://serper.dev/dashboard

5. **Test Serper API directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://google.serper.dev/search \
     -H "X-API-KEY: your_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"q":"NFL injury report"}'
   ```

### If dates still wrong:

1. Verify server was restarted after changes
2. Check browser cache (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Verify timezone in odds API response (commence_time field)
4. Check server logs for MT timezone messages

## Additional Notes

- Research is cached for 30 minutes to save API quota
- Research prioritizes games starting soon and with more markets
- Low risk parlays get "deep" research, medium/high get "moderate"
- Player research only runs for NFL, NCAAF, NBA with player props
- All external API calls have proper error handling and fallbacks
