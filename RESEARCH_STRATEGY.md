# 🔍 Smart Tiered Research Strategy

## Problem Statement

The previous bulk research approach had critical flaws:
- **1 search for 50+ games** = generic, unfocused results
- **0 seconds research time** = hitting cache or skipping entirely  
- **No game-specific insights** = poor reasoning for each leg
- **Low confidence picks** = not meeting user expectations

## New Solution: Smart Tiered Research

### 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Research deeply on games most likely to be selected
2. **Risk-Aware**: Low risk needs 8-9 confidence (deep research), Medium/High can be more selective
3. **Focused Queries**: Game-specific searches with player context
4. **Efficient API Usage**: Batch processing with smart caching

## 📊 How It Works

### TIER 1: Prioritization
```
50 games available → Prioritize by:
- Time until game (sooner = higher priority)
- Number of betting markets available
- Competitive odds (close games)
```

### TIER 2: Research Depth
```
Low Risk:    Deep research (5 players, detailed analysis)
Medium Risk: Moderate research (3 players, focused analysis)
High Risk:   Moderate research (3 players, focused analysis)
```

### TIER 3: Smart Batching
```
Need 10 legs? Research 30 games (3x multiplier)
- Batch 1: Games 1-5   (5 API calls)
- Batch 2: Games 6-10  (5 API calls)
- Batch 3: Games 11-15 (5 API calls)
- etc.
```

## 🔬 Research Process Per Game

### Step 1: Game-Level Research
**Query:** `{Team A} vs {Team B} {Year} {Date} injury report recent performance trends prediction`

**Extracts:**
- Injury reports
- Recent team performance
- Head-to-head trends
- Weather conditions
- Betting line movement

### Step 2: Player-Level Research (if deep mode)
**Query:** `{Team A} {Team B} {Date} {Year} players {Player1, Player2, Player3} stats recent performance touchdowns`

**Extracts:**
- Player recent stats
- Touchdown trends
- Matchup-specific insights
- Team context for each player

### Step 3: Synthesis
Combines game + player research into comprehensive summary (1200-2000 chars)

## 📈 API Usage Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Cache TTL**: 10 minutes
- **Cache Key**: Lowercase query string
- **Hit Rate**: ~60-70% on repeated requests

### Batch Processing
- **Batch Size**: 5 games at a time
- **Concurrent Requests**: 5 max
- **Total API Calls**: 
  - Low Risk (10 legs): ~60 calls (30 games × 2 calls each)
  - Medium Risk (10 legs): ~30 calls (30 games × 1 call each)
  - High Risk (10 legs): ~30 calls (30 games × 1 call each)

### Rate Limit Management
- **Serper Free Tier**: 2,500 searches/month
- **Daily Budget**: ~83 searches/day
- **Per Request**: 30-60 searches (fits within budget)

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### For Low Risk Parlays
- ✅ Deep research on 30+ games
- ✅ 8-9 confidence picks only
- ✅ Detailed reasoning with player insights
- ✅ High probability of all legs hitting

### For Medium/High Risk Parlays
- ✅ Focused research on 30+ games
- ✅ 6-8 confidence picks with good reasoning
- ✅ Balanced value and probability
- ✅ Compelling narratives for each leg

### Research Quality Metrics
- ✅ **Research Time**: 15-30 seconds (vs 0 seconds before)
- ✅ **Games Researched**: 30+ (vs 0 before)
- ✅ **Research Depth**: 1200-2000 chars per game (vs 200 before)
- ✅ **Confidence Levels**: Aligned with risk level

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters

```javascript
// In research-agent.js
const researchMultiplier = 3; // Research 3x the legs needed
const batchSize = 5;          // Process 5 games at a time
const deepPlayerCount = 5;    // Research 5 players for deep mode
const moderatePlayerCount = 3; // Research 3 players for moderate mode
```

### Risk Level Mapping

```javascript
Low Risk:    researchDepth = 'deep'     → 5 players, 2 API calls per game
Medium Risk: researchDepth = 'moderate' → 3 players, 1 API call per game  
High Risk:   researchDepth = 'moderate' → 3 players, 1 API call per game
```

## 📊 Example: 10-Leg NCAA Parlay (Low Risk)

### Input
- 50 games available
- 10 legs needed
- Low risk level

### Process
1. **Prioritize**: Sort 50 games by priority score
2. **Select**: Top 30 games (10 legs × 3 multiplier)
3. **Research**: 
   - Batch 1-6: 30 games in 6 batches of 5
   - Each game: 2 API calls (game + players)
   - Total: 60 API calls
4. **Cache**: Subsequent requests use cached data
5. **Time**: ~20-25 seconds

### Output
- 30 games with comprehensive research
- Each game has:
  - Team matchup analysis
  - Injury reports
  - Player stats and trends
  - 1500+ chars of research data
- AI selects best 10 legs with 8-9 confidence
- Detailed reasoning for each pick

## 🔄 Fallback Strategy

If research fails or API is unavailable:
1. Use cached data if available
2. Fall back to odds-only analysis
3. Lower confidence ratings appropriately
4. Inform user of limited research
