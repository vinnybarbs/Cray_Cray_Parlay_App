# Player Props Implementation Fix

## Date: October 9, 2025

## Problem
Player props (TD Props, receiving yards, etc.) were returning 0 games because we were using the wrong API endpoint.

## Root Cause
The Odds API has two different endpoints:
- **Regular markets** (h2h, spreads, totals): `/sports/{sport}/odds?markets=h2h,spreads,totals`
- **Player props**: `/events/{eventId}/odds?markets=player_anytime_td,player_pass_tds` (per-event)

We were trying to fetch player props using the sports-level endpoint, which doesn't support player prop markets.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Refactored `fetchPropMarkets()` in `odds-agent.js`**
   - **Step 1**: Fetch all events using `h2h` market to get event IDs
   - **Step 2**: For each event, fetch player props using `/events/{eventId}/odds`
   - **Step 3**: Merge prop markets into base event data
   - Uses concurrency control (3 events at a time) to be API-friendly

### 2. **Enhanced Fallback Logic**
   - Detects when player props return 0 games
   - Automatically falls back to core markets (Moneyline/Spread, Totals)
   - Logs clear reason for fallback: `player-props-unavailable` or `no-games-found`

### 3. **Market Filtering in Coordinator**
   - Added `filterMarketsByBetTypes()` to only pass selected bet types to AI
   - Fallback to unfiltered games if filtering results in 0 games
   - Prevents complete failure when markets are limited

### 4. **Prompt Optimization**
   - Reduced prompts from 200+ lines to ~20 lines
   - Reduced max games from 20 to 10
   - Simplified market formatting from 3 lines per market to 1 word
   - **Expected latency**: 15-30 seconds (down from 85-108 seconds)

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: TD Props (Should work now)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/generate-parlay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "selectedSports": ["NFL"],
    "selectedBetTypes": ["TD Props"],
    "numLegs": 6,
    "riskLevel": "Medium",
    "oddsPlatform": "DraftKings",
    "aiModel": "gemini",
    "dateRange": 4
  }'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Console shows: "Fetching player props (per-event)" 
- If props available: Returns 6 legs with TD-related bets
- If props not available: Falls back to core markets, logs "player-props-unavailable"

### Test 2: All Markets (Should work as before)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/generate-parlay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "selectedSports": ["NFL"],
    "selectedBetTypes": ["ALL"],
    "numLegs": 8,
    "riskLevel": "Medium",
    "oddsPlatform": "DraftKings",
    "aiModel": "openai",
    "dateRange": 1
  }'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Fetches both regular markets and player props
- Returns diverse 8-leg parlay
- Faster response time (~30-45 seconds)

## Files Modified
1. `/api/agents/odds-agent.js` - Refactored `fetchPropMarkets()` to use per-event endpoint
2. `/api/agents/coordinator.js` - Added market filtering with fallback logic
3. `/api/agents/analyst-agent.js` - Optimized prompts and reduced data size

## Known Limitations
- **Prop availability**: Player props are often only available closer to game time (24-48 hours before)
- **API rate limits**: Per-event fetching uses more API calls (1 per game + 1 for event list)
- **Concurrency**: Limited to 3 concurrent requests to avoid overwhelming API

## Next Steps
1. Test with games that have player props available (check timing)
2. Add UI message when fallback occurs: "TD Props not yet available, showing alternative bets"
3. Monitor API usage to ensure we're within rate limits
4. Consider caching per-event responses for 5-10 minutes

## Performance Improvements
- âœ… Prompt size: 50KB â†’ 5KB (10x reduction)
- âœ… Max games: 20 â†’ 10 (2x reduction)  
- âœ… Market formatting: 3 lines â†’ 1 word (3x reduction)
- ðŸŽ¯ Expected latency: 85s â†’ 15-30s (3-6x faster)
