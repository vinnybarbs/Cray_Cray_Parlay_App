# üéØ Confidence Level Strategy by Risk Level

## Philosophy

The purpose of a parlay is to string together multiple high-probability bets for a positive payout. Even 5 legs at -200 odds each creates a profitable parlay. **Low risk should prioritize WINNING, not maximizing payout.**

---

## Risk Level Definitions

### üõ°Ô∏è Low Risk (Conservative)
**Goal**: WIN the parlay, not maximize payout
**Confidence**: ALL legs MUST be 8-9/10
**Strategy**: 
- Focus on favorites and safe bets
- Data-backed picks only
- Heavy favorites acceptable (-200, -300 odds)
- 5 legs at -200 = profitable parlay
- Example: "Team is 10-2 at home, opponent missing 3 starters"

**Typical Odds Range**: -300 to +100
**Expected Payout**: Lower but consistent
**Win Probability**: High (60-70% parlay success rate)

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Medium Risk (Balanced)
**Goal**: Balance probability and payout
**Confidence**: ALL legs MUST be 6-9/10
**Strategy**:
- Mix of favorites and value picks
- Some underdogs with strong data support
- Balanced approach
- Example: "Team is 7-3 ATS, getting 3 points at home"

**Typical Odds Range**: -150 to +200
**Expected Payout**: Moderate
**Win Probability**: Medium (40-50% parlay success rate)

---

### üöÄ High Risk (Aggressive)
**Goal**: Maximize payout with calculated risks
**Confidence**: Legs can be 3-9/10
**Strategy**:
- Include upsets and underdogs
- Analyst picks with reasoning
- High-reward opportunities
- Mix of safe bets and moonshots
- Example: "Underdog getting 7 points, but they've covered 8 of last 10"

**Typical Odds Range**: -100 to +500
**Expected Payout**: High
**Win Probability**: Lower (20-30% parlay success rate)

## Confidence Level Meanings

### 9/10 - Near Lock
- Heavy favorite with overwhelming data
- Multiple factors align perfectly
- Minimal risk of upset
- Example: "#1 defense vs #32 offense, home field advantage"

### 8/10 - Strong Favorite
- Clear advantage with strong data support
- Minor concerns but heavily favored
- Example: "Team is 8-2 ATS at home, opponent on 3-game road trip"

### 7/10 - Solid Pick
- Good data support, reasonable confidence
- Some risk but favorable matchup
- Example: "Team averaging 30 PPG, opponent allows 28 PPG"

### 6/10 - Slight Edge
- Data suggests advantage but not overwhelming
- Could go either way
- Example: "Team is 5-5 ATS but getting 3 points at home"

### 5/10 - Coin Flip
- Even matchup, slight lean based on data
- High variance
- Example: "Both teams 6-4, similar stats, home field only advantage"

### 4/10 - Underdog with Reasoning
- Data suggests upset potential
- Going against the grain
- Example: "Underdog but they've won 3 of last 4 vs this opponent"

### 3/10 - Long Shot
- Significant underdog but calculated risk
- High reward if hits
- Example: "Major underdog but opponent missing key players"

## Why This Matters

### The Math of Parlays

**Low Risk Example (5 legs at -200 each):**
```
Individual probability: ~67% each
Parlay probability: 0.67^5 = 13.5%
Decimal odds: 2.5^5 = 97.66
American odds: +9666
Payout on $100: $9,766

Even with "boring" -200 favorites, the parlay is profitable!
```

**The Key**: String together HIGH PROBABILITY bets, not high payout bets.
